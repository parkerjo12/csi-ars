			Accident Investigation is a fact gathering process whereby the accident scene and vehicles are documented by measurements and photographs. Obtaining witness statements and/or driver statements should further enhance the investigation
			process, and these statements are obtained only upon request. Sometimes a
			thorough accident investigation can resolve issues that may arise later.

			and it should not be relied upon in place of an investigation or reconstruction for

			destroyed in the crash or the data can be altered. And yes, sometimes it does
			capture the correct data.
